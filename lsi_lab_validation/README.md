# LSI Lab Validation
Life Science Institute (LSI) Lab at the University of British Columbia (UBC) has a fluigent microfluid dispensing system.

They can dispense reagents at a regulated flow rate. The flowsensor used in this system is the Sensirion SLI-0430 FMK flowsensor. 

As described in the key documents, we connect our low cost flowsensor in series with SLI-0430. We assume that the fluigent system is regulating the flow rate perfectedly and we record the flow rate output of our low cost flowsensor and save it in text files.
